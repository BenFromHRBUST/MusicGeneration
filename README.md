# Music Generation with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Music Generation project using Machine Learning and Guitar Pro format.
This project focuses on developing and evaluating models capable of generating music, specifically utilizing the rich expressive capabilities of the Guitar Pro format.

## Project Overview
This research aims to explore the generation of music using machine learning models trained on Guitar Pro format datasets.
It addresses challenges such as capturing expressive guitar techniques and creating musically coherent pieces that respect the intricacies of guitar music.
This involves experimenting with different architectures including LSTMs, GRUs, and the Mambas.
